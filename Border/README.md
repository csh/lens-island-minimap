Simple 250x250 [Krita](https://krita.org) template for creating an overlay to decorate the minimap.

A mask has been provided that prevents you from drawing into the area the minimap will fill.

You can still draw into this area (for stuff like vignettes) but be mindful of the fact that it will be rendered on top of the minimap image.
